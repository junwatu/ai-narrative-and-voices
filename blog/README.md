# Leveraging AI to Generate Narrative Voices and Titles for Documentary Videos

## **Introduction**

- Briefly introduce the growing role of AI in content creation, specifically for documentaries.
- Explain the focus of the blog: generating narrative voices and titles using AI.
- Mention the tech stack: Node.js, GridDB, OpenAI, and React.

## Run The Application

Brief instruction to get the application code run.

## **Problem Statement**

- Challenges faced in manually generating compelling narratives and titles.
- Time constraints and creative block issues in traditional methods.

## **Tech Stack Overview**

- **Node.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests and server-side operations.
- **GridDB**: A NoSQL time-series database to manage video metadata and context data.
- **OpenAI**: The core AI for generating narrative text and title ideas.
- **React**: Frontend UI for interacting with the AI and managing the output.

## **System Architecture**

- **Data Flow Diagram**: Outline the interaction between each component (OpenAI API, GridDB, Node.js backend, and React frontend).
- **Component Breakdown**: Explain how each technology contributes to the solution.

## **Implementation**

- **Setting Up Node.js with GridDB**: Step-by-step guide on connecting Node.js to GridDB for storing and retrieving relevant data.
- **Integrating OpenAI for Text Generation**: API integration for generating narrative text and titles.
- **Building the React Frontend**: Creating a UI for users to input prompts, view AI suggestions, and manage generated content.

## **AI Content Generation Workflow**

### **Storing Video Metadata in GridDB**

How metadata like themes, topics, and timestamps help refine AI output.

### **Generating Narrative Voices**

Fine-tuning OpenAI’s models to produce engaging and relevant narrative content.

### **Creating Titles**

Using AI to generate impactful and attention-grabbing titles based on the video’s content.
